# hello-world
this is my first repository

Hi,friends from all over world!

I'am here today. At this moment, I am very excited. Because,I believe my English level can be improved on GitHub. Of cource, I can also learn more about programming techniques on java. What is more important is that I can study, communicate and collaborate with friends from all over the world.

I am a rookie who loves programming,hoping to learn here. Thank you.
